Run Main.py

Depth can be changed in depth_limit in Main.py

Algorithm completely implemented in Node.py

Deviated from spec when returning the utility function of win/lose state since it may be larger/smaller than the evaluation function score which will cause algorithm to return unoptimal state. I instead return the MAX or MIN constant defined in Node.py to ensure that a win state has higher value than any other state.
